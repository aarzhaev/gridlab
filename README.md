A suite of maxforlive monome devices

Developed for Berklee ISEL-112 Grid Performance Studies 

This collection of devices is currently under active development. Expect continual changes. 

Requires the latest version of Max. You must also ensure that Ableton Live is pointing to the latest version of Max. (Live Preferences>File / Folder tab > Max Application.) If you're not getting LED feedback on the arc, make sure you check this. If you're experiencing issues with these devices, edit the device and open the Max window to check to see if any errors are thrown. Please submit bug reports via the issues tab here on github.

Principles
* Optimized for 128-format grids, although other grid sizes and multiple-monome configurations may be supported
* Varibright monome grid required
* Utilizes sync via Ableton Live Link - by default, devices should stay in phase with the transport when possible
* Autofocus with LED state caching
